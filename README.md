- Main page with the Quiz content: Website name logo, navigation menu (Home and Quiz?), quiz game section (score information, user name, and restart button), and
Footer with Developer's Name Information.
- Information page (Quiz?): Navigation menu (Home and Quiz?) followed by informative text on the theme "Mental Agility", and Footer with Developer's Name Information.
